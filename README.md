# covid19de_monitor

A simple python script to retrieve COVID19 data from the german RKI (Robert Koch-Institut).

## Motivation

The script collects 7-day-by-100K-people incidents for a pre-defined number of areas.
The data API of the RKI is used:
`https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/917fc37a709542548cc3be077a786c17_0`

## Usage

### Command Line

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            Lists the available areas of interest as config JSON.
  -f FIND, --find FIND  Find & filters the available areas of interest
                        according to the given string (case sensitive!).
  -a AREAS, --areas AREAS
                        Receives JSON file with defined areas of interest.
  -i INCIDENCE, --incidence INCIDENCE
                        Find all areas with names including the given string
                        and return the 100k-7 incidence.
```

#### Examples

Find all 100k-by-7-days incidences for areas including the String "Berlin":

`python COVIDUpdate.py -i Berlin`

Find all 100k-by-7-days incidences for areas defined in the JSON file `areas_example.json`:

`python COVIDUpdate.py -a areas_example.json`

Define or extend a JSON config file for areas, by finding area definitions,
e.g. find all areas including the String "Berlin":

`python COVIDUpdate.py -f Berlin`

### API

You may call the script within your own code.
The following snippet retrieves the data for the area of interest "Würzburg city".

```
areas = [{'GEN': 'Würzburg', 'BEZ': 'Kreisfreie Stadt'}]
cu = COVIDUpdate()
result = cu.check(areas)
print(result)
```

See the included Slack bots for another example of API use.

## Compatibilty

The script is used with Python 3.8

# IntensivRegisterUpdate

Provides information about the current utilization of intensive care beds in Germany.
Uses the API from [intensivregister.de](https://www.intensivregister.de/#/aktuelle-lage/laendertabelle) and fetches data from:

# Slack Bot (Using `slackclient`)

Let's you directly send the COVID19 data to a slack channel via a custom Slack APP.
Using [slacks python library](https://pypi.org/project/slackclient/).

## Requirements

### slackclient

`pip install slackclient`

### Building your own slack App

1.  Go to your slack workspace and select Manage Apps from Settings & administration

    <img src="./img/ws-settings.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 33%;" />

2.  Hit Build on the top right

    ![img](./img/build-app.png)

3.  Next click on create App

    ![img](./img/create-app.png)

4.  Name your App and select your preferred workspace

    ![img](./img/create-slack-app.png)

5.  Change the Permissions of your App

    ![img](./img/permissions.png)

6.  Add OAuth Scopes to your App

    ![img](./img/add-oauth-scope.png)

7.  Add chat:write and chat:write.public

    ![img](./img/added-scopes.png)

8.  Install the App to your workspace

    ![img](./img/install-to-workspace.png)

9.  Copy your Bot token and insert it in SlackBot.py

    ![img](./img/copy-token.jpg)

10. Finally change the channel in SlackBot.py to your desired channel

# Slack Bot (using `bolt`)

Similar to the simple bot, this bot will keep running in the background and post updates at a given time every day.
You can configure the channel, trigger time and channel to send to via the `slack.config.json` file expected in `$PWD/config/`.

## Requirements

In addition to a `pip install slack_bolt`, follow the [Bolt Getting Started](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-python)
guide to get a set of token and signing secret needed to connect the bot to Slack.

## Docker deployment

The included `Dockerfile` produces a container running the bot, exposing port 3000 for incoming messages.
Be sure to bind-mount the `slack.config.json` to `/app/config` or make it otherwise available.
